# Sheet Renderer

NodeJS library that renders a sheet from the [`sheet-schema` data format](../sheet-schema/README.md) into publishing markup formats like HTML and PDF.

Aspired formats:
- [ ] HTML: for web presentation in the browser and the app
- [ ] PDF: for print and e-readers (as paid option maybe?)
